## **Backend**

The backend provides APIs that are documented and accessible through Postman. You can refer to the official [API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/31736145/2sA3kRL56j) for detailed information on endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples for **sheero**.

### **Folder Content**

#### `config/`
- **checkEnv.js**: Ensures that required environment variables are defined. If any are missing, it throws an error with a clear message.
- **cookie.js**: Configures cookie settings for JWT token management, ensuring that authentication tokens are securely handled.
- **cors.js**: Sets up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings, allowing or restricting access to the backend from specific domains.
- **db.js**: Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database, enabling the backend to read and write data to the database.
- **dotenv.js**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file. This is essential for securely storing sensitive configuration values (like database credentials, API keys, and secrets). It uses the `dotenv` package to load variables, and if any are missing or undefined, it will throw an error.
- **emailService.js**: Sends emails for different purposes using the configured SMTP settings defined in `mailer.js`.
- **emailUtils.js**: Utility functions for sending emails.
- **mailer.js**: Configures a Gmail SMTP transporter for sending emails using the `nodemailer` library.
- **passport.js**: Configures strategies for user authentication via third-party services like Google and Facebook using Passport.js.
- **server.js**: Initializes and starts the server, setting up necessary configurations and listening for incoming API requests.

#### `controllers/`
- Contains the controller functions that define the core logic for each API endpoint. Each controller corresponds to an endpoint defined in the `routes/` folder.

#### `middleware/`
- Contains middleware functions that process requests before they reach the controller. Examples include authentication checks, file uploads, and data validation.

#### `models/`
- Contains MongoDB schema definitions for various entities (like User, Product, etc.) used in the database. This provides a structure for how data is stored and queried.

#### `routes/`
- Defines the API routes (URLs) and associates them with corresponding controller functions. This folder also handles route-level middleware applications like authentication and validation.

#### `uploads/`
- A folder where uploaded images are stored.

#### `validations/`
- Contains validation schemas using the `yup` library to ensure that incoming request data (e.g., JSON payloads) matches expected formats, improving reliability and security.
