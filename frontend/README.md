# Frontend

The frontend serves as the user interface layer of the application, interacting with the backend via API calls to provide a seamless experience for users.

## Project Structure

The frontend is structured to ensure maintainability, scalability, and ease of development. Key features include:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture.
- **Vite:** A fast and lightweight build tool that offers a superior development experience with instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- **Material-UI:** A popular React UI framework for building responsive and modern interfaces.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs directly in your markup.
- **Framer Motion:** A powerful library for creating animations and gestures for React components.
- **React Router:** A standard library for routing in React applications, enabling navigation among views.
- **React Toastify:** A library for adding toast notifications to React apps, improving user feedback.

## Backend

This frontend communicates with a robust backend API, which is fully documented and accessible through Postman. For detailed information on the API endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples, please refer to the official [API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/31736145/2sA3kRL56j) for sheero.

## Documentation

More detailed frontend documentation, covering component structures, state management, and routing logic, will be added in future commits.
